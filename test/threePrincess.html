<p>There were once upon a time a <em>King</em> and <em>Queen</em> who had no children, and they took it so much  to heart that they hardly ever had a happy  moment. One day the <em>King</em> stood in the portico and  looked out over the big meadows and all that was his.  But he felt he could have no enjoyment out of it all, since  he did not know what would become of it after his time.  As he stood there pondering, an old beggar woman came  up to him and asked him for a trifle in heaven&rsquo;s name.  She greeted him and curtsied, and asked what ailed the <em>King</em>, since he looked so sad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do anything to help me, my good woman,&rdquo;  said the <em>King</em>; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no use telling you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not so sure about that,&rdquo; said the beggar  woman. &ldquo;Very little is wanted when luck is in the  way. The <em>King</em> is thinking that he has no heir to his  crown and kingdom, but he need not mourn on that  account,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The <em>Queen</em> shall have three  daughters, but great care must be taken that they do not  come out under the open heavens before they are all   fifteen years old; otherwise a snowdrift will come and  carry them away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the time came the <em>Queen</em> had a beautiful baby  girl; the year after she had another, and the third year  she also had a girl.</p>
<p>The <em>King</em> and <em>Queen</em> were glad beyond all measure;  but although the <em>King</em> was very happy, he did not forget  to set a watch at the Palace door, so that the <em>Princesses</em> should not get out.</p>
<p>As they grew up they became both fair and beautiful,  and all went well with them in every way. Their only  sorrow was that they were not allowed to go out and play  like other children. For all they begged and prayed  their parents, and for all they besought the sentinel, it  was of no avail; go out they must not before they were  fifteen years old, all of them.</p>
<p>So one day, not long before the fifteenth birthday of  the youngest <em>Princess</em>, the <em>King</em> and the <em>Queen</em> were out  driving, and the <em>Princesses</em> were standing at the window  and looking out. The sun was shining, and everything  looked so green and beautiful that they felt that they  must go out, happen what might. So they begged and  entreated and urged the sentinel, all three of them, that  he should let them down into the garden. &ldquo;He could  see for himself how warm and pleasant it was; no snowy  weather could come on such a day.&rdquo; Well, he didn&rsquo;t  think it looked much like it either, and if they must go  they had better go, the soldier said; but it must only be  for a minute, and he himself would go with them and  look after them.</p>
<p>When they got down into the garden they ran up and  down, and filled their laps with flowers and green leaves,  the prettiest they could find. At last they could manage  no more, but just as they were going indoors they caught  sight of a large rose at the other end of the garden. It was  many times prettier than any they had gathered, so they  must have that also. But just as they bent down to take  the rose a big dense snowdrift came and carried them away.</p>
<p>There was great mourning over the whole country,  and the <em>King</em> made known from all the churches that any  one who could save the <em>Princesses</em> should have half the  kingdom and his golden crown and whichever princess  he liked to choose.</p>
<p>You can well understand there were plenty who wanted  to gain half the kingdom, and a princess into the bargain;  so there were people of both high and low degree who set out for all parts of the country. But there was no  one who could find the <em>Princesses</em>, or even get any tidings  of them.</p>
<p>When all the grand and rich people in the country  had had their turn, a captain and a lieutenant came to the  Palace, and wanted to try their luck. The <em>King</em> fitted  them out both with silver and gold, and wished them  success on their journey.</p>
<p>Then came a soldier, who lived with his mother in a  little cottage some way from the Palace. He had dreamt  one night that he also was trying to find the <em>Princesses</em>.  When the morning came he still remembered what he had  dreamt, and told his mother about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some witchery must have got hold of you,&rdquo; said the  woman, &ldquo;but you must dream the same thing three nights  running, else there is nothing in it.&rdquo; And the next two  nights the same thing happened; he had the same dream,  and he felt he must go. So he washed himself and put  on his uniform, and went into the kitchen at the Palace.  It was the day after the captain and the lieutenant had  set out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better go home again,&rdquo; said the <em>King</em>, &ldquo;the <em>Princesses</em> are beyond your reach, I should say; and   besides, I have spent so much money on outfits that I  have nothing left to-day. You had better come back  another time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I go, I must go to-day,&rdquo; said the soldier. &ldquo;Money  I do not want; I only need a drop in my flask and some  food in my wallet,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but it must be a good  walletful&mdash;as much meat and bacon as I can carry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, that he might have if that was all he wanted.</p>
<p>So he set off, and he had not gone many miles before  he overtook the captain and the lieutenant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked the captain, when he  saw the man in uniform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try if I can find the <em>Princesses</em>,&rdquo;  answered the soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are we,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;and since your  errand is the same, you may keep company with us, for  if we don&rsquo;t find them, you are not likely to find them  either, my lad,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>When they had gone awhile the soldier left the high  road, and took a path into the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;it is best  to follow the high road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said the soldier, &ldquo;but this is my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kept to the path, and when the others saw this they  turned round and followed him. Away they went further  and further, far across big moors and along narrow valleys.</p>
<p>And at last it became lighter, and when they had got  out of the forest altogether they came to a long bridge,  which they had to cross. But on that bridge a bear  stood on guard. He rose on his hind legs and came  towards them, as if he wanted to eat them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do now?&rdquo; said the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say that the bear is fond of meat,&rdquo; said the  soldier, and then he threw a fore quarter to him, and so  they got past. But when they reached the other end of  the bridge, they saw a lion, which came roaring towards  them with open jaws as if he wanted to swallow them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we had better turn right-about, we shall  never be able to get past him alive,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think he is so very dangerous,&rdquo; said the  soldier; &ldquo;I have heard that lions are very fond of bacon,  and I have half a pig in my wallet;&rdquo; and then he threw  a ham to the lion, who began eating and gnawing, and  thus they got past him also.</p>
<p>In the evening they came to a fine big house. Each  room was more gorgeous than the other; all was glitter   and splendour wherever they looked; but that did not  satisfy their hunger. The captain and the lieutenant  went round rattling their money, and wanted to buy some  food; but they saw no people nor could they find a  crumb of anything in the house, so the soldier offered  them some food from his wallet, which they were not too  proud to accept, nor did they want any pressing. They  helped themselves of what he had as if they had never  tasted food before.</p>
<p>The next day the captain said they would have to go  out shooting and try to get something to live upon.  Close to the house was a large forest where there were  plenty of hares and birds. The lieutenant was to remain  at home and cook the remainder of the food in the  soldier&rsquo;s wallet. In the meantime the captain and the  soldier shot so much game that they were hardly able to  carry it home. When they came to the door they found  the lieutenant in such a terrible plight that he was scarcely  able to open the door to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with you?&rdquo; said the captain.  The lieutenant then told them that as soon as they were  gone a tiny, little man, with a long beard, who went on  crutches, came in and asked so plaintively for a penny; but   no sooner had he got it than he let it fall on the floor,  and for all he raked and scraped with his crutch he was  not able to get hold of it, so stiff and stark was he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pitied the poor, old body,&rdquo; said the lieutenant,  &ldquo;and so I bent down to pick up the penny, but then he  was neither stiff nor stark any longer. He began to  belabour me with his crutches till very soon I was unable  to move a limb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself! you, one of  the king&rsquo;s officers, to let an old cripple give you a thrashing,  and then tell people of it into the bargain!&rdquo; said the  captain. &ldquo;Pshaw! to-morrow I&rsquo;ll stop at home, and then  you&rsquo;ll hear another story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day the lieutenant and the soldier went out  shooting and the captain remained at home to do the  cooking and look after the house. But if he fared no  worse, he certainly fared no better than the lieutenant.  In a little while the old man came in and asked for a  penny. He let it fall as soon as he got it; gone it was  and could not be found. So he asked the captain to help  him to find it, and the captain, without giving a thought,  bent down to look for it. But no sooner was he on his  knees than the cripple began belabouring him with his   crutches, and every time the captain tried to rise, he got  a blow which sent him reeling. When the others came  home in the evening, he still lay on the same spot and  could neither see nor speak.</p>
<p>The third day the soldier was to remain at home,  while the other two went out shooting. The captain  said he must take care of himself, &ldquo;for the old fellow will  soon put an end to you, my lad,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there can&rsquo;t be much life in one if such an old  crook can take it,&rdquo; said the soldier.</p>
<p>They were no sooner outside the door, than the old  man came in and asked for a penny again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money I have never owned,&rdquo; said the soldier, &ldquo;but  food I&rsquo;ll give you, as soon as it is ready,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but  if we are to get it cooked, you must go and cut the  wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t, you must learn,&rdquo; said the soldier.  &ldquo;I will soon show you. Come along with me down to the  wood-shed.&rdquo; There he dragged out a heavy log and cut  a cleft in it, and drove in a wedge till the cleft deepened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you must lie down and look right along the cleft,  and you&rsquo;ll soon learn how to cut wood,&rdquo; said the soldier.   &ldquo;In the meantime I&rsquo;ll show you how to use the axe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man was not sufficiently cunning, and did as  he was told; he lay down and looked steadily along the  log. When the soldier saw the old man&rsquo;s beard had got  well into the cleft, he struck out the wedge; the cleft  closed and the old man was caught by the beard. The  soldier began to beat him with the axe handle, and then  swung the axe round his head, and vowed that he would  split his skull if he did not tell him, there and then, where  the <em>Princesses</em> were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare my life, spare my life, and I&rsquo;ll tell you!&rdquo; said  the old man. &ldquo;To the east of the house there is a big  mound; on top of the mound you must dig out a square  piece of turf, and then you will see a big stone slab.  Under that there is a deep hole through which you must  let yourself down, and you&rsquo;ll then come to another world  where you will find the <em>Princesses</em>. But the way is long  and dark and it goes both through fire and water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the soldier got to know this, he released the  old man, who was not long in making off.</p>
<p>When the captain and lieutenant came home they  were surprised to find the soldier alive. He told them  what had happened from first to last, where the <em>Princesses</em>   were and how they should find them. They became as  pleased as if they had already found them, and when they  had had some food, they took with them a basket and as  much rope as they could find, and all three set off to the  mound. There they first dug out the turf just as the old  man had told them, and underneath they found a big stone  slab, which it took all their strength to turn over. They  then began to measure how deep it was; they joined on  ropes both two and three times, but they were no nearer  the bottom the last time than the first. At last they had  to join all the ropes they had, both the coarse and fine,  and then they found it reached the bottom.</p>
<p>The captain was, of course, the first who wanted  to descend; &ldquo;But when I tug at the rope you must  make haste to drag me up again,&rdquo; he said. He found  the way both dark and unpleasant, but he thought he  would go on as long as it became no worse. But all at  once he felt ice cold water spouting about his ears; he  became frightened to death and began tugging at the rope.</p>
<p>The lieutenant was the next to try, but it fared no  better with him. No sooner had he got through the  flood of water than he saw a blazing fire yawning beneath  him, which so frightened him that he also turned back.</p>
<p>The soldier then got into the bucket, and down he  went through fire and water, right on till he came to the  bottom, where it was so pitch dark that he could not see  his hand before him. He dared not let go the basket,  but went round in a circle, feeling and fumbling about  him. At last he discovered a gleam of light far, far  away like the dawn of day, and he went on in that  direction.</p>
<p>When he had gone a bit it began to grow light around  him, and before long he saw a golden sun rising in the  sky and everything around him became as bright and  beautiful as if in a fairy world.</p>
<p>First he came to some cattle, which were so fat that  their hides glistened a long way off, and when he had got  past them he came to a fine, big palace. He walked  through many rooms without meeting anybody. At last  he heard the hum of a spinning wheel, and when he  entered the room he found the eldest <em>Princess</em> sitting  there spinning copper yarn; the room and everything in  it was of brightly polished copper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear; oh, dear! what are Christian people doing  here?&rdquo; said the <em>Princess</em>. &ldquo;Heaven preserve you! what  do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to  set you free and  get you out of the  mountain,&rdquo; said  the soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray do not  stay. If the troll  comes home he  will put an end to  you at once; he  has three heads,&rdquo;  said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not care  if he has four,&rdquo;  said the soldier. &ldquo;I am here, and here I shall remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you will be so headstrong, I must see if I  can help you,&rdquo; said the <em>Princess</em>.</p>
<p>She then told him to creep behind the big brewing  vat which stood in the front hall; meanwhile she would  receive the troll and scratch his heads till he went to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I go out and call the hens you must  make haste and come in,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But you must first  try if you can swing the sword which is lying on the  table.&rdquo; No, it was too heavy, he could not even move  it. He had then to take a strengthening draught from  the horn, which hung behind the door; after that he  was just able to stir it, so he took another draught,  and then he could lift it. At last he took a right,  big draught, and he could swing the sword as easily as  anything.</p>
<p>All at once the troll came home; he walked so  heavily that the palace shook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh, ugh! I smell Christian flesh and blood in  my house,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the <em>Princess</em>, &ldquo;a raven flew past here  just now, and in his beak he had a human bone, which  he dropped down the chimney; I threw it out and swept  and cleaned up after it, but I suppose it still smells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it does,&rdquo; said the troll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But come and lie down and I&rsquo;ll scratch your heads,&rdquo;  said the <em>Princess</em>; &ldquo;the smell will be gone by the time  you wake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The troll was quite willing, and before long he fell  asleep and began snoring. When she saw he was sleeping  soundly, she placed some stools and cushions under  his heads and went to call the hens. The soldier then   stole into the room with the sword, and with one blow  cut all the three heads off the troll.</p>
<p>The <em>Princess</em> was as pleased as a fiddler, and went  with the soldier to her sisters, so that he could also set  them free. First of all they went across a courtyard and  then through many long rooms till they came to a big  door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you must enter: here she is,&rdquo; said the <em>Princess</em>.  When he opened the door he found himself in a large  hall, where everything was of pure silver; there sat the  second sister at a silver spinning-wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear; oh, dear!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What do you  want here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to set you free from the troll,&rdquo; said the  soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray do not stay, but go,&rdquo; said the <em>Princess</em>. &ldquo;If  he finds you here he will take your life on the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be awkward&mdash;that is if I don&rsquo;t take his  first,&rdquo; said the soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since you will stay,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you will have  to creep behind the big brewing-vat in the front hall. But  you must make haste and come as soon as you hear me  calling the hens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First of all he had to try if he was able to swing the  troll&rsquo;s sword, which lay on the table; it was much larger  and heavier than the first one; he was hardly able to move  it. He then took three draughts from the horn and he  could then lift it, and when he had taken three more he  could handle it as if it were a rolling pin.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards he heard a heavy, rumbling noise  that was quite terrible, and directly afterwards a troll with  six heads came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh, ugh!&rdquo; he said as soon as he got his noses  inside the door. &ldquo;I smell Christian blood and bone in  my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, just think! A raven came flying past here with  a thigh-bone, which he dropped down the chimney,&rdquo; said  the <em>Princess</em>. &ldquo;I threw it out, but the raven brought it  back again. At last I got rid of it and made haste to  clean the room, but I suppose the smell is not quite gone,&rdquo;  she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can smell it well,&rdquo; said the troll; but he was  tired and put his heads in the <em>Princess&rsquo;s</em> lap, and she went  on scratching them till they all fell a-snoring. Then she  called the hens, and the soldier came and cut off all the  six heads as if they were set on cabbage stalks.</p>
<p>She was no less glad than her elder sister, as you may  imagine, and danced and sang; but in the midst of their  joy they remembered their youngest sister. They went  with the soldier across a large courtyard, and, after walking  through many, many rooms, he came to the hall of gold  where the third sister was.</p>
<p>She sat at a golden spinning-wheel spinning gold yarn,  and the room from ceiling to floor glistened and glittered  till it hurt one&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven preserve both you and me, what do you  want here?&rdquo; said the <em>Princess</em>. &ldquo;Go, go, else the troll  will kill us both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as well two as one,&rdquo; answered the soldier. The <em>Princess</em> cried and wept; but it was all of no use, he must  and would remain. Since there was no help for it he  would have to try if he could use the troll&rsquo;s sword on  the table in the front hall. But he was only just able to  move it; it was still larger and heavier than the other two  swords.</p>
<p>He then had to take the horn down from the wall  and take three draughts from it, but was only just able to  stir the sword. When he had taken three more draughts  he could lift it, and when he had taken another three he   swung it as easily  as if it had been a  feather.</p>
<p>The <em>Princess</em> then settled with  the soldier to do  the same as her  sisters had done.  As soon as the troll  was well asleep she  would call the  hens, and he must  then make haste  and come in and  put an end to the troll.</p>
<p>All of a sudden they heard such a thundering, rambling  noise, as if the walls and roof were tumbling in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! Ugh! I smell Christian blood and bone in  my house,&rdquo; said the troll, sniffing with all his nine noses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you never saw the like! Just now a raven flew  past here and dropped a human bone down the chimney.  I threw it out, but the raven brought it back, and this  went on for some time,&rdquo; said the <em>Princess</em>; but she got it  buried at last, she said, and she had both swept and  cleaned the place, but she supposed it still smelt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can smell it well,&rdquo; said the troll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here and lie down in my lap and I will  scratch your heads,&rdquo; said the <em>Princess</em>. &ldquo;The smell will  be all gone when you awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did so, and when he was snoring at his best she  put stools and cushions under the heads so that she could  get away to call the hens. The soldier then came in in  his stockinged feet and struck at the troll, so that eight  of the heads fell off at one blow. But the sword was  too short and did not reach far enough; the ninth head  woke up and began to roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! Ugh! I smell a Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, here he is,&rdquo; answered the soldier, and before  the troll could get up and seize hold of him the soldier  struck him another blow and the last head rolled along  the floor.</p>
<p>You can well imagine how glad the <em>Princesses</em> became  now that they no longer had to sit and scratch the trolls&rsquo;  heads; they did not know how they could do enough for  him who had saved them. The youngest <em>Princess</em> took off  her gold ring and knotted it in his hair. They then took   with them as much gold and silver as they thought they  could carry and set off on their way home.</p>
<p>As soon as they tugged at the rope the captain and the  lieutenant pulled up the <em>Princesses</em>, the one after the other.  But when they were safely up, the soldier thought it was  foolish of him not to have gone up before the <em>Princesses</em>,  for he had not very much belief in his comrades. He  thought he would first try them, so he put a heavy lump  of gold in the basket and got out of the way. When the  basket was half-way up they cut the rope and the lump  of gold fell to the bottom with such a crash that the pieces  flew about his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we are rid of him,&rdquo; they said, and threatened  the <em>Princesses</em> with their life if they did not say that it was  they who had saved them from the trolls. They were  forced to agree to this, much against their will, and especially  the youngest <em>Princess</em>; but life was precious, and  so the two who were strongest had their way.</p>
<p>When the captain and lieutenant got home with the <em>Princesses</em> you may be sure there were great rejoicings at  the palace. The <em>King</em> was so glad he didn&rsquo;t know which  leg to stand on; he brought out his best wine from his  cupboard and wished the two officers welcome. If they   had never been honoured before they were honoured now  in full measure, and no mistake. They walked and strutted  about the whole of the day, as if they were the cocks of  the walk, since they were now going to have the <em>King</em> for father-in-law. For it was understood they should  each have whichever of the <em>Princesses</em> they liked and half  the kingdom between them. They both wanted the  youngest <em>Princess</em>, but for all they prayed and threatened  her it was of no use; she would not hear or listen to  either.</p>
<p>They then asked the <em>King</em> if they might have twelve  men to watch over her; she was so sad and melancholy  since she had been in the mountain that they were afraid  she might do something to herself.</p>
<p>Yes, that they might have, and the <em>King</em> himself told  the watch they must look well after her and follow her  wherever she went and stood.</p>
<p>They then began to prepare for the wedding of the  two eldest sisters; it should be such a wedding as never  was heard or spoken of before, and there was no end to  the brewing and the baking and the slaughtering.</p>
<p>In the meantime the soldier walked and strolled about  down in the other world. He thought it was hard that   he should see neither people nor daylight any more; but  he would have to do something, he thought, and so for  many days he went about from room to room and opened  all the drawers and cupboards and searched about on the  shelves and looked at all the fine things that were there.  At last he came to a drawer in a table, in which there lay  a golden key; he tried this key to all the locks he could  find, but there was none it fitted till he came to a little  cupboard over the bed, and in that he found an old rusty  whistle. &ldquo;I wonder if there is any sound in it,&rdquo; he  thought, and put it to his mouth. No sooner had he  whistled than he heard a whizzing and a whirring from  all quarters, and such a large flock of birds swept down,  that they blackened all the field in which they settled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does our master want to-day?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
<p>If he were their master, the soldier said, he would  like to know if they could tell him how to get up to the  earth again. No, none of them knew anything about  that; &ldquo;But our mother has not yet arrived,&rdquo; they said;  &ldquo;if she can&rsquo;t help you, no one can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he whistled once more, and shortly heard something  flapping its wings far away, and then it began to blow so  hard that he was carried away between the houses like a   wisp of hay across the courtyard, and if he had not caught  hold of the fence he would no doubt have been blown  away altogether.</p>
<p>A big eagle&mdash;bigger than you can imagine&mdash;then  swooped down in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come rather sharply,&rdquo; said the soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you whistle so I come,&rdquo; answered the eagle. So  he asked her if she knew any means by which he could  get away from the world in which they were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get away from here unless you can fly,&rdquo;  said the eagle, &ldquo;but if you will slaughter twelve oxen for  me, so that I can have a really good meal, I will try and  help you. Have you got a knife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I have a sword,&rdquo; he said. When the eagle  had swallowed the twelve oxen she asked the soldier to kill  one more for victuals on the journey. &ldquo;Every time I gape  you must be quick and fling a piece into my mouth,&rdquo; she  said, &ldquo;else I shall not be able to carry you up to earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did as she asked him and hung two large bags of  meat round her neck and seated himself among her feathers.  The eagle then began to flap her wings and off they went  through the air like the wind. It was as much as the soldier  could do to hold on, and it was with the greatest   difficulty he managed to throw the pieces of flesh into the  eagle&rsquo;s mouth every time she opened it.</p>
<p>At last the day began to dawn, and the eagle was then  almost exhausted and began flapping with her wings, but  the soldier was prepared and seized the last hind quarter  and flung it to her. Then she gained strength and brought  him up to earth. When she had sat and rested a while at  the top of a large pine-tree she set off with him again at  such a pace that flashes of lightning were seen both by  sea and land wherever they went.</p>
<p>Close to the palace the soldier got off and the eagle  flew home again, but first she told him that if he at any  time should want her he need only blow the whistle and  she would be there at once.</p>
<p>In the meantime everything was ready at the palace,  and the time approached when the captain and lieutenant  were to be married with the two eldest <em>Princesses</em>, who,  however, were not much happier than their youngest  sister; scarcely a day passed without weeping and mourning,  and the nearer the wedding-day approached the more  sorrowful did they become.</p>
<p>At last the <em>King</em> asked what was the matter with  them; he thought it was very strange that they were not   merry and happy now that they were saved and had been  set free and were going to be married. They had to give  some answer, and so the eldest sister said they never would  be happy any more unless they could get such checkers as  they had played with in the blue mountain.</p>
<p>That, thought the <em>King</em>, could be easily managed, and  so he sent word to all the best and cleverest goldsmiths in  the country that they should make these checkers for the <em>Princesses</em>. For all they tried there was no one who could  make them. At last all the goldsmiths had been to the  palace except one, and he was an old, infirm man who had  not done any work for many years except odd jobs, by  which he was just able to keep himself alive. To him the  soldier went and asked to be apprenticed. The old man  was so glad to get him, for he had not had an apprentice  for many a day, that he brought out a flask from his chest  and sat down to drink with the soldier. Before long the  drink got into his head, and when the soldier saw this he  persuaded him to go up to the palace and tell the <em>King</em> that he would undertake to make the checkers for the <em>Princesses</em>.</p>
<p>He was ready to do that on the spot; he had made  finer and grander things in his day, he said. When the  <em>King</em> heard there was some one outside who could make  the checkers he was not long in coming out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true what you say, that you can make such  checkers as my daughters want?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is no lie,&rdquo; said the goldsmith; that he would  answer for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well!&rdquo; said the <em>King</em>. &ldquo;Here is the gold  to make them with; but if you do not succeed you will  lose your life, since you have come and offered yourself,  and they must be finished in three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning when the goldsmith had slept off  the effects of the drink, he was not quite so confident  about the job. He wailed and wept and blew up his  apprentice, who had got him into such a scrape while he  was drunk. The best thing would be to make short  work of himself at once, he said, for there could be no  hope for his life; when the best and grandest goldsmiths  could not make such checkers, was it likely that he could  do it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fret on that account,&rdquo; said the soldier, &ldquo;but  let me have the gold and I&rsquo;ll get the checkers ready in time;  but I must have a room to myself to work in,&rdquo; he said.  This he got, and thanks into the bargain.</p>
<p>The time wore on, and the soldier did nothing but  lounge about, and the goldsmith began to grumble, because  he would not begin with the work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry yourself about it,&rdquo; said the soldier,  &ldquo;there is plenty of time! If you are not satisfied with  what I have promised you had better make them yourself.&rdquo;  The same thing went on both that day and the next; and  when the smith heard neither hammer nor file from the  soldier&rsquo;s room the whole of the last day, he quite gave  himself up for lost; it was now no use to think any longer  about saving his life, he thought.</p>
<p>But when the night came on the soldier opened the  window and blew his whistle. The eagle then came and  asked what he wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those gold checkers, which the <em>Princesses</em> had  in the blue mountain,&rdquo; said the soldier; &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll  want something to eat first, I suppose? I have two  ox carcases lying ready for you in the hay-loft yonder;  you had better finish them,&rdquo; he said. When the eagle  had done she did not tarry, and long before the sun  rose she was back again with the checkers. The  soldier then put them under his bed and lay down to  sleep.</p>
<p>Early next morning the goldsmith came and knocked  at his door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you after now again?&rdquo; asked the soldier.  &ldquo;You rush about enough in the day, goodness knows!  If one cannot have peace when one is in bed, whoever  would be an apprentice here?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>Neither praying nor begging helped that time; the  goldsmith must and would come in, and at last he was  let in.</p>
<p>And then, you may be sure, there was soon an end  to his wailing.</p>
<p>But still more glad than the goldsmith were the <em>Princesses</em>, when he came up to the palace with the  checkers, and gladdest of all was the youngest <em>Princess</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you made them yourself?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, if I must speak the truth, it is not I,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;but my apprentice, who has made them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see that apprentice,&rdquo; said the <em>Princess</em>.  In fact all three wanted to see him, and if he valued his  life, he would have to come.</p>
<p>He was not afraid, either of women-folk or grand-folk,  said the soldier, and if it could be any amusement to them  to look at his rags, they should soon have that pleasure.</p>
<p>The youngest <em>Princess</em> recognised him at once; she  pushed the soldiers aside and ran up to him, gave him her  hand, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day, and many thanks for all you have done  for us. It is he who freed us from the trolls in the  mountain,&rdquo; she said to the <em>King</em>. &ldquo;He is the one I will  have!&rdquo; and then she pulled off his cap and showed them  the ring she had tied in his hair.</p>
<p>It soon came out how the captain and lieutenant had  behaved, and so they had to pay the penalty of their  treachery with their lives, and that was the end of their  grandeur. But the soldier got the golden crown and  half the kingdom, and married the youngest <em>Princess</em>.</p>
<p>At the wedding they drank and feasted both well and  long; for feast they all could, even if they could not find  the <em>Princesses</em>, and if they have not yet done feasting and  drinking they must be at it still.</p>
